                        <p class="text">English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. 
                                        Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation 
                                        of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a 
                                        general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

                        <p class="text">Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in Paddington, London. 
                                        His family was upper middle class. He was the second son of Julius Mathison 
                                        Turing and Ethel Sara, who remained in India for several years, for which he 
                                        spent his childhood with his older brother John.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing attended Hazelhurst High School, an independent school in the Sussex (now East East) village of Frant.</p>
                        <p class="text">In 1926, aged thirteen, he entered Sherborne Boarding School in Dorset. His first day of school coincided with a general strike in England, but his determination to attend class was so great that he rode his bicycle alone the more than 60 miles from Southampton to his school, spending the night in an inn. . Such a feat was picked up in the local press.</p>
                        <p class="text">Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not command the respect of his professors at Sherborne, whose concept of education placed greater emphasis on the classics. At Sherbone's school, he won most of the mathematical prizes that were awarded and, in addition, he carried out chemical experiments on his behalf although the opinion of the faculty regarding Turing's independence and ambition was not very favorable. Despite this, Turing continued to show a singular ability for the studies that he really liked, and he managed to solve problems that were very advanced for his age (16 years) without even having studied elementary calculus.</p>
                        <p class="text">In 1936 he published his important study “Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem”, Alan Turing reformulated the results of Kurt Gödel in 1931 on the limits of provability and computation, changing to the universal formal language for what is known today as a Turing machine. He also found that the machine could solve any mathematical problem that could be represented by an algorithm.</p>
                        <p class="text">Alan Turing carried out several works with Norbert Wiener in the development of cybernetics, which was generated from the demand for control systems that were required in the development of production techniques from the 20th century.</p>
                        <p class="text">In 1952 he appeared before the police to report a robbery and during the statement he indicated his homosexuality, for which he was accused of gross indecency and sexual perversion, which at that time were considered serious crimes in the United Kingdom. He was given the choice between entering prison or chemical castration and he opted for the latter, which produced physical changes affecting his work.</p>
                        <p class="text">Alan Mathison Turing died in Wilmslow, Cheshire, on June 7, 1954 after giving himself poison, perhaps by accident. His mother argued that the death was due to the accidental ingestion of cyanide from his fingers after a chemical experiment, but it is more credible that he planned his death.</p>

                        <h3 class="">Cryptanalysis</h3>
                        <p class="text">During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."</p>
                        <p class="text">From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker. Soon after the July 1939 meeting near Warsaw at which the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages, Turing and Knox developed a broader solution. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they in fact did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe (an improvement on the Polish Bomba).</p>
                        <p class="text">Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure dubbed Banburismus for making much more efficient use of the bombes; developing a procedure dubbed Turingery for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) cipher machine and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.</p>
                        <h3 class="">Bombe</h3>
                        <p class="text">Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park, Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.</p>
                        <p class="text">By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.</p>
                        <p class="text">On 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter had an electric effect." Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth." More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.</p>
                        <h3 class="">Turingery</h3>
                        <p class="text">In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus) for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.  He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.</p>
                        <h3 class="">Early computers and the Turing test</h3>
                        <p class="text">In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death. During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics, and in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.</p>
                        <p class="text">In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing "ran" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. According to Garry Kasparov, Turing's program "played a recognizable game of chess." The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife, Isabel.</p>
                        <p class="text">His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative, and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.</p>
