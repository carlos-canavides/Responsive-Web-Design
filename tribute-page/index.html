                        <p class="text">English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. 
                                        Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation 
                                        of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a 
                                        general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

                        <p class="text">Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in Paddington, London. 
                                        His family was upper middle class. He was the second son of Julius Mathison 
                                        Turing and Ethel Sara, who remained in India for several years, for which he 
                                        spent his childhood with his older brother John.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing attended Hazelhurst High School, an independent school in the Sussex (now East East) village of Frant.</p>
                        <p class="text">In 1926, aged thirteen, he entered Sherborne Boarding School in Dorset. His first day of school coincided with a general strike in England, but his determination to attend class was so great that he rode his bicycle alone the more than 60 miles from Southampton to his school, spending the night in an inn. . Such a feat was picked up in the local press.</p>
                        <p class="text">Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not command the respect of his professors at Sherborne, whose concept of education placed greater emphasis on the classics. At Sherbone's school, he won most of the mathematical prizes that were awarded and, in addition, he carried out chemical experiments on his behalf although the opinion of the faculty regarding Turing's independence and ambition was not very favorable. Despite this, Turing continued to show a singular ability for the studies that he really liked, and he managed to solve problems that were very advanced for his age (16 years) without even having studied elementary calculus.</p>
